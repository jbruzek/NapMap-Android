# NapMap-Android

NapMap is built for VT Hacks 2015.
I collaborated on this project with Adam Barnes. I built the Android app and he built the website.

**Have you ever really *really* wanted to take a nap, but didn't know where you should go?**

NapMap is the answer. 

NapMap is a service where people can post their favorite nap spots on campus. Once a nap is sumbitted, other users can review the nap, giving it a rating (1 to 5 pillows) and comment on nap locations. The most popular nap locations get featured more prominently on the NapMap home page.

In addition to submitting nap locations, users can indicate when they are currently using a location to nap. That way when someone checks to find a good nap location they can avoid places that are already being used.

Through the process of building NapMap, Adam and I learned:
* Material design for Android and web
* Google Maps for Android and web
* Parse for Android and Javascript
